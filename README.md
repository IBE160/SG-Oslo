This project introduces StudyBuddy AI, a smart learning assistant designed to help students learn more efficiently. Many students struggle to process large volumes of text from lectures, labs, and readings, making it challenging to find effective ways to create study materials.

StudyBuddy AI addresses this challenge by using artificial intelligence to generate summaries, flashcards, and quiz questions from uploaded study materials. By automating the creation of study aids, the application promotes active learning through repetition and self-testing. It also serves as a practical example of how AI can be effectively utilized as a learning tool in higher education.

The target users for this application include university, college, and high school students who want to study more effectively. It is also a valuable tool for teachers and teaching assistants who wish to quickly generate learning materials and quizzes for their classes.
