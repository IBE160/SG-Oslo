I've found some excellent design system options that can help us achieve the "sleek, nice, and easy to click around" experience you're looking for, making StudyBuddy AI applicable to everyone.

Think of design systems like a foundation - they provide proven UI components and patterns, so we're not reinventing buttons and forms. This speeds development and ensures consistency.

**Your Options:**

1.  **Bootstrap (with Material Design Principles and Custom Theming)**
    *   **Key Strengths:** Highly flexible and customizable, excellent built-in accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA support, keyboard navigation), robust responsive design, extensive documentation, and a large community. Can be themed to achieve a sleek, modern look.
    *   **Best for:** Projects needing a solid, accessible foundation that can be visually tailored without a heavy JavaScript framework, aligning well with your "simple web UI" requirement.

2.  **Pure Material Design (principles-based CSS framework like Materialize)**
    *   **Key Strengths:** Naturally aligns with a modern, clean Google-inspired aesthetic. Offers a good set of pre-designed components.
    *   **Best for:** Projects where a strong Material Design aesthetic is desired out-of-the-box.

3.  **Custom Design System**
    *   **Key Strengths:** Complete visual uniqueness and control.
    *   **Best for:** Projects with very specific, unique brand identities or complex, novel interaction requirements not covered by existing frameworks.
    *   **Consideration:** Requires significant effort and time, which might not align with an MVP or class project scope.

**My Recommendation:** I recommend **Bootstrap (with Material Design Principles and Custom Theming)**. It provides an excellent balance of robust, accessible components and styling flexibility. This is crucial for achieving the experience you desire while also being efficient for an MVP built with FastAPI HTML templates. We can apply the clean, intuitive visual language of Material Design on top of Bootstrap for the desired aesthetic.
