## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Validate the technical feasibility of the AI-powered features.
*   Test user demand and gather feedback for future development.
*   Evaluate the usability and performance of the application.
*   Demonstrate the value of the application for students.

### Background Context

Students are currently facing a significant challenge in managing the large volume of information from their courses. They spend a considerable amount of time on manual and inefficient tasks like summarizing notes and creating flashcards, which detracts from their actual learning. Existing tools do not adequately address this problem, creating a clear need for a solution that can automate the creation of study materials and help students learn more effectively. The StudyBuddy AI project aims to fill this gap by providing an intelligent, all-in-one platform that saves students time and enhances their learning experience.

## UX and UI Vision

### UX Principles

The user experience should feel fast, simple, and focused â€” minimizing friction and helping students get from upload to studying as quickly as possible. The visual tone should be calm and academic, avoiding distractions and promoting a sense of productivity. The interface should communicate clarity and confidence, with clean layouts, clear feedback, and minimal visual noise. Every interaction should reinforce efficiency and ease of use, with instant feedback and short response times to keep the user engaged.

### UI Design Goals

*   **Login & Registration Page:** Simple sign-in with email or social login. Clean, welcoming design with the StudyBuddy AI logo and a short tagline.
*   **Dashboard (Home View):** Central hub to upload new files, see progress indicators, and view a list of previously saved study sets.
*   **Study Session View:** Displays the generated summary, flashcards, and quiz in separate tabs or collapsible sections. Flashcards should be interactive, and quizzes should show immediate feedback.
*   **Saved Content / Library View:** Shows all previously generated study sets, with quick access to reopen and continue studying.
