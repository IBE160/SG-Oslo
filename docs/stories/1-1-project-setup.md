# Story 1.1: Project Setup

Status: drafted

## Story

As a developer,
I want to set up the initial project structure with a FastAPI backend and a simple UI,
so that we have a foundation to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new Git repository is created for the project.
2. A virtual environment for Python is set up.
3. FastAPI is installed and a basic "Hello World" endpoint is working.
4. A simple HTML template is created for the main page.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize Git repository.
- [ ] Create a Python virtual environment.
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.
- [ ] Create `main.py` with a "Hello World" endpoint.
- [ ] Create `templates/index.html`.

## Dev Notes

- Backend: FastAPI
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (served from FastAPI)

### Project Structure Notes

- The project structure should follow the one defined in `docs/architecture.md`.
