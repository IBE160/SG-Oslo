## Executive Summary

StudyBuddy AI is an intelligent, all-in-one study assistant designed to automatically transform raw study materials into a suite of interactive learning aids. By simply uploading their notes and readings, students will instantly receive AI-generated summaries, flashcards, and quizzes, all from a single, integrated workflow. The primary problem being solved is the inefficiency and time-consuming nature of manual study material preparation. The target market is university and college students who are looking for a more efficient way to study. The key value proposition is to save students time, improve their learning efficiency, and provide a personalized learning experience.

## Problem Statement

Students are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information from lectures and readings. They spend 4-6 hours per course each week on manual, time-consuming tasks like summarizing content and creating flashcards. This significant time investment is often spent on low-value organizational work rather than on deep learning, leading to shallow knowledge retention and inefficient studying. Existing methods fail to provide an automated way to create structured study aids, leaving a critical gap for a solution that can save students time and improve their learning outcomes.

## Proposed Solution

StudyBuddy AI is an intelligent, all-in-one study assistant that automatically transforms raw study materials into a suite of interactive learning aids. By simply uploading their notes and readings, students will instantly receive AI-generated summaries, flashcards, and quizzes from a single, integrated workflow.

Our key differentiator is our focus on active learning. Unlike simple note-storage apps, StudyBuddy AI uses artificial intelligence to understand the context of the material and generate structured, personalized content that promotes active recall and self-testing. The ideal user experience is seamless and intuitive, feeling less like a tool and more like a personal tutor that guides learning and helps students focus on what matters most.

The result is a fast, simple, and motivating platform that not only saves students countless hours but also fundamentally improves their understanding and long-term retention. Future versions will enhance this personalized experience with adaptive difficulty and multi-language support.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

*   **File Upload:** Users can upload text-based PDF and DOCX files (up to 10 MB).
*   **AI Content Generation:** For each uploaded file, the AI will generate:
    *   One summary (short or medium).
    *   10 flashcards (Question/Answer format).
    *   6 multiple-choice questions (4 options, 1 correct).
*   **Content Management:** Users can view, save, and re-open their generated content.
*   **Authentication:** Secure user sign-in, with each user's data kept private.

## Risks and Open Questions

### Key Risks

*   **Content accuracy:** AI-generated summaries or quizzes may contain errors or irrelevant details, reducing user trust.
*   **User adoption:** Students may find the tool interesting but not return if the output quality or usability feels limited.
*   **Integration challenges:** Technical issues connecting APIs (e.g., authentication or AI model response formatting) could delay progress.
*   **Scope management:** With limited time, balancing core functionality and polish could be difficult within 6 weeks.
*   **Data handling:** Even with minimal data, ensuring proper user privacy and deletion remains important.

### Open Questions

*   How accurate and useful will the AI-generated content be across different subjects and writing styles?
*   What prompt designs or formatting methods produce the most consistent and reliable outputs?
*   How can we best measure learning improvement or user satisfaction in a small-scale test?
*   If expanded later, what business or sustainability model (e.g., subscription, university integration) would make sense?
