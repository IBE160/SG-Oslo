# Epic 2 Retrospective: AI-Powered Study Material Generation

**Date:** 2025-11-08
**Epic ID:** 2
**Epic Title:** AI-Powered Study Material Generation
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This retrospective covers Epic 2, focusing on the development of AI-powered study material generation features. This epic included functionalities such as file upload, AI content generation (summaries, flashcards, quizzes), displaying generated content, quiz interaction, and saving study sets.

## Stories Completed

- **Story 2.1: File Upload**
  - **Description:** As a user, I want to be able to upload various document types (PDF, DOCX), So that the system can process them for study material generation.
  - **Status:** Done
  - **Key Learnings/Notes:** Implemented robust file type and size validation. Temporary storage of uploaded files was crucial for subsequent processing.

- **Story 2.2: AI Content Generation**
  - **Description:** As a user, I want the system to automatically generate a summary, flashcards, and a quiz after I upload a file, So that I can quickly start studying.
  - **Status:** Done
  - **Key Learnings/Notes:** Successfully integrated Google Gemini API. Prompt engineering was key to getting desired output formats for summaries, flashcards, and quizzes. Initial implementation uses placeholder for Gemini model, which will need to be refined for production.

- **Story 2.3: Display Generated Content**
  - **Description:** As a user, I want to be able to view the generated summary, flashcards, and quiz, So that I can start studying.
  - **Status:** Done
  - **Key Learnings/Notes:** Created a dedicated "Study Session" page. Displaying content involved careful handling of different data structures (plain text for summary, JSON arrays for flashcards and quizzes).

- **Story 2.4: Quiz Interaction**
  - **Description:** As a user, I want to be able to answer the quiz questions and get immediate feedback, So that I can test my knowledge.
  - **Status:** Done
  - **Key Learnings/Notes:** Implemented client-side JavaScript for interactive quiz elements, including immediate feedback and score tracking. This significantly enhanced user engagement.

- **Story 2.5: Save Study Set**
  - **Description:** As a user, I want to be able to explicitly save a generated study set, So that I can access it later.
  - **Status:** Done
  - **Key Learnings/Notes:** Implemented a backend endpoint to update the status of a study set in Firestore, allowing users to mark content for later access. This provides a basic persistence mechanism.

## What Went Well

- **Gemini API Integration:** The integration with the Google Gemini API was straightforward and allowed for rapid prototyping of AI generation features.
- **Modular Development:** Breaking down the epic into smaller stories (file upload, AI generation, display, interaction, save) allowed for focused development and easier tracking of progress.
- **Firestore Usage:** Firestore proved to be an effective and flexible database for storing both raw file content and generated study materials.
- **Client-side Interactivity:** The use of client-side JavaScript for quiz interaction provided a responsive and engaging user experience.

## What Could Be Improved

- **Error Handling for AI Generation:** More robust error handling and retry mechanisms for Gemini API calls could be implemented.
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Further refinement of prompts could lead to even higher quality and more consistent AI-generated content.
- **Scalability of File Processing:** For very large files, the current in-memory processing might be a bottleneck. Consider streaming or background processing for future iterations.
- **User Feedback on AI Progress:** While a message is displayed, a more detailed progress indicator during AI generation would improve UX.

## Action Items

- **Refine AI Prompts:** Dedicate time to experiment with and optimize prompts for Gemini to improve output quality.
- **Implement Background Processing:** Investigate options for asynchronous file processing and AI generation to prevent UI blocking.
- **Enhance UI/UX for Study Session:** Improve the visual design and interactivity of the "Study Session" page, especially for flashcards and quizzes.
- **Consider User Authentication Integration:** Integrate Firebase authentication more deeply with Firestore security rules to ensure data privacy and ownership.

## Conclusion

Epic 2 successfully delivered the core AI-powered study material generation features. The foundation is now in place for further enhancements and expansion of AI capabilities within the StudyBuddy AI application. The team gained valuable experience in integrating external AI services and managing complex data flows.
