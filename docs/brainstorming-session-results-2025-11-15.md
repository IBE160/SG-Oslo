# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-11-15
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Brainstorming on saving, reviewing, and managing generated study content for the StudyBuddy AI application, with a focus on expanding beyond the initial proposal.

**Session Goals:** To explore innovative features and improvements for content management and review, making the process more effective and engaging for students.

**Techniques Used:** SCAMPER Method

**Total Ideas Generated:** 7

### Key Themes Identified:

Key themes identified were: 1) Shifting from manual organization to AI-driven contextualization (Topic Maps), 2) Enhancing user engagement through flexibility and social features (Micro-learning, Competitions), and 3) Simplifying the technical architecture by leveraging user-owned cloud storage.

## Technique Sessions

### SCAMPER Method Results

We applied the SCAMPER method to the concept of "saving, reviewing, and managing study content."

*   **S (Substitute):** We substituted manual file/folder management with an **AI-driven "Topic Map."** This would automatically organize content by topic, helping students discover new connections between their study materials and promoting a more holistic understanding.

*   **C (Combine):** We combined the "Topic Map" idea with content generation. The AI could use the contextual understanding from the map to create **more reflective and less mechanical flashcards and quizzes.**

*   **A (Adapt):** We adapted the experience for different learning styles by suggesting the AI could **automatically find or generate relevant images and diagrams** to accompany text-based study materials, aiding visual learners.

*   **M (Modify):** We modified the scale of the review process to support **"micro-learning."** This involves offering flexible, bite-sized review sessions (e.g., 5-minute quizzes) that can be done on-the-go, providing a sense of accomplishment even with limited time.

*   **P (Put to another use):** We identified two new uses for the generated content:
    1.  **Social Competition:** Turning quizzes into a competitive game against other users.
    2.  **AI Tutoring:** Using summaries and quiz results for the AI to provide personalized recommendations on what to study next.

*   **E (Eliminate):** We proposed eliminating the need for app-hosted storage. This would be achieved with a persistent **"Save to..." button that connects directly to the user's own cloud storage** (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.), simplifying the backend and giving users more control.

*   **R (Reverse):** We reversed the standard workflow. Instead of generating content and then managing it, the user would first be **interviewed by the AI about their study goals, timeline, and focus.** The AI would then generate a custom study plan and content tailored to that specific intent.
