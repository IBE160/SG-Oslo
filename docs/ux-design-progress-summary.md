# UX Design Progress Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-20

This document summarizes the key outcomes and decisions from the collaborative UX design workflow for the StudyBuddy AI application.

## Key Accomplishments

-   **Defined Core UX:** Established the project's vision, user profile, core experience, and desired emotional goals (control, efficiency, fun, achievement).
-   **Established Visual Foundation:** Created a comprehensive style guide, including a fresh, modern color palette, typography scale (using the 'Inter' font), and an 8pt grid system for layout and spacing.
-   **Selected Design System:** Chose **Bootstrap (with Material Design Principles and Custom Theming)** as the foundational design system to ensure a balance of accessibility, flexibility, and development efficiency.
-   **Explored Design Directions:** Generated and refined interactive HTML mockups to visualize and decide on the application's look and feel, settling on a **"Dynamic & Engaging"** direction with a pastel color palette.
-   **Implemented Pastel Color Palette:** Updated the primary, secondary, and neutral colors across the design specification and visualizer to the new pastel scheme.
-   **Defined Core UI Components:** Detailed the design and functionality of key UI elements including a dropdown hamburger menu, a logged-in user dropdown with content categories, quiz generation options (15-min and 1-hour deep dive), and enhanced flashcards with visual placeholders.

## Key Deliverables

The following artifacts have been created and committed to the repository:

1.  **UX Design Specification (`docs/ux-design-specification.md`)**
    *   A comprehensive document detailing all design decisions, including the core experience, visual foundation, and design direction. Updated to include navigation details and core component specifications.

2.  **Color Theme Visualizer (`docs/ux-color-themes.html`)**
    *   An interactive HTML file showcasing the final color palette and its application on various UI components. Updated to reflect the new pastel color palette and include interactive examples of the hamburger menu, user dropdown, quiz options, and flashcards with visuals.

3.  **Design Direction Showcase (`docs/ux-design-directions.html`)**
    *   An interactive HTML file presenting the refined design direction for key screens, including the Dashboard and Study Session View, based on user feedback.

## Next Steps

With the foundational UX and visual design established, the project is well-positioned for the next phases, which could include:

-   Developing high-fidelity mockups of all screens.
-   Designing detailed user journeys and interaction flows.
-   Creating a comprehensive component library based on the chosen design system and style guide.
