# UX Design Workflow - Progress Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-18

This document summarizes the progress made on the **Create UX Design** workflow for the **studyBuddy-AI** project.

## Current Status

We are currently in the middle of the `create-ux-design` workflow. We have completed the initial "Discovery and Understanding" phase (Step 1) and are ready to move on to defining the visual foundation of the application.

## Key Decisions and Findings So Far

*   **Project Vision Confirmed:** The goal is to create an AI-powered study assistant that automates the creation of summaries, flashcards, and quizzes to save students time and improve learning efficiency.
*   **Core Experience Defined:** The central user action is uploading a document and instantly receiving a suite of study materials. The experience must be fast, simple, and frictionless.
*   **Desired Emotional Response:** The application should make users feel **efficient, productive, creative, and inspired**.
*   **Inspiration Analysis:** We analyzed Goodnotes, Outlook Calendar, and Teams. Key takeaways for studyBuddy-AI include the need for strong AI integration, a clean and intuitive UI, high performance, effective content organization, and personalization.

## Next Steps

The next step in the workflow is **Step 2: Discover and evaluate design systems**. This involves choosing a foundational UI component library (like Material UI, Chakra UI, etc.) to ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience.

## How to Resume

When you are ready to continue, simply tell me to **"resume the UX design workflow"** or a similar command. We will pick up exactly where we left off.

All our progress has been saved in the main `ux-design-specification.md` document.
