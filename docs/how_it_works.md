How it works

StudyBuddy-AI transforms your uploaded study materials into personalized summaries, flashcards, and quizzes—making learning faster and more effective.

1. Upload Your Study Material
Upload your documents in PDF or DOCX format containing lectures, articles, or course notes.

Simply drag and drop or select files from your device.

Your files are securely linked to your account, allowing easy access anytime.

2. Automated Text Extraction and Analysis
The backend extracts text from your documents and prepares it for processing.

Advanced AI services—primarily Google Gemini and optionally OpenAI GPT-4—analyze the content to identify key concepts, main points, and quiz questions.

All generated learning resources are stored in Firestore for seamless retrieval.

3. Personalized Learning Resources
Receive concise summaries to quickly grasp essential information.

Use automatically created flashcards to practice key terms and definitions with active recall.

Test your understanding with quizzes tailored to the uploaded text.

4. Interactive Learning Experience
Engage with flashcards and quizzes in a user-friendly, interactive interface designed for focused study sessions.

Reinforce learning by repeating difficult flashcards and questions until mastery.

Track your progress and integrate StudyBuddy-AI as a companion to your own notes and lectures.

5. Practical AI Use
StudyBuddy-AI supports learning by structuring and simplifying content without replacing your own study efforts.

The AI responsibly aids comprehension and retention, avoiding fabrication of information.

This project showcases practical applications of generative AI in higher education, shortening the time from raw material to actionable learning aids.
