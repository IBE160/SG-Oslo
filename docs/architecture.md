# Decision Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture for the StudyBuddy AI project. The architecture is designed to be simple, scalable, and easy to build upon, with a focus on using modern, well-supported technologies. The core of the architecture is a FastAPI backend with a simple HTML/CSS frontend, using Firebase for data persistence, authentication, and file storage. The AI-powered features will be provided by Google Gemini, with OpenAI's GPT-4 as a backup.

## Epic to Architecture Mapping

*   **Epic 1: Core Application Setup and User Authentication** -> This epic will be implemented in the `main.py` file and the `templates` folder, with user data being stored in Firestore.
*   **Epic 2: AI-Powered Study Material Generation** -> This epic will involve the `main.py` file for the API endpoints, Firebase Storage for file uploads, and the integration with the Google Gemini and OpenAI APIs.

## Technology Stack Details

### Core Technologies

*   **Backend:** FastAPI
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (served from FastAPI)
*   **Database:** Firestore
*   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
*   **File Storage:** Firebase Storage
*   **AI Service:** Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4

### Integration Points

*   The frontend will communicate with the backend via a REST API.
*   The backend will communicate with Firestore, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Storage using the official Firebase Python libraries.
*   The backend will communicate with the Google Gemini and OpenAI APIs using their respective Python libraries.

## Implementation Patterns

*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Python variables and functions: `snake_case`
    *   HTML/CSS classes: `kebab-case`
    *   API endpoints: `/api/v1/...`
*   **Code Organization:**
    *   API routes will be organized into separate files in a `routers` directory as the application grows.
    *   Reusable functions will be placed in a `utils` directory.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   The API will return standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).
    *   Error messages will be clear and concise.
*   **Logging:**
    *   The application will use the standard Python `logging` module.
    *   Logs will be written to the console.

## Data Architecture

*   **Users:** A `users` collection in Firestore will store user information (e.g., user ID, email).
*   **Files:** A `files` collection in Firestore will store metadata about the uploaded files (e.g., file name, user ID, storage path).
*   **Study Sets:** A `study_sets` collection in Firestore will store the generated content (summary, flashcards, quiz), linked to the user and the uploaded file.

## API Contracts

*   The API will use JSON for all request and response bodies.
*   A detailed API specification (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger) will be created as part of the implementation of Epic 2.

## Security Architecture

*   All API endpoints that require authentication will be protected using Firebase Authentication.
*   User passwords will not be stored in our database; they will be managed by Firebase Authentication.
*   All user data will be stored securely in Firestore and Firebase Storage, with access controls to ensure that only the owner of the data can access it.

## Performance Considerations

*   For the PoC, we will focus on a simple and clean implementation. Performance optimization will be a focus for future versions.
*   The AI content generation will be an asynchronous process to avoid blocking the main application thread.

## Deployment Architecture

*   For the PoC, the application can be deployed to a simple cloud service like Heroku or a small virtual private server (VPS).
*   A more robust deployment architecture (e.g., using Docker and a cloud provider like Google Cloud or AWS) will be considered for future versions.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   A Google Firebase project.
*   API keys for Google Gemini and OpenAI.

### Setup Commands

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the application
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

*   **ADR-001: Choice of Backend Framework:** We have chosen FastAPI as our backend framework due to its high performance, ease of use, and excellent support for asynchronous operations.
*   **ADR-002: Choice of Database and Authentication:** We have chosen to use Firebase Firestore and Firebase Authentication to leverage the Firebase ecosystem, which provides a secure and easy-to-use solution for data persistence and user management.
*   **ADR-003: Choice of File Storage:** We have chosen to use Firebase Storage for file uploads to keep our architecture consistent with the rest of the Firebase services.
